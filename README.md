#Sorting Visualizer
This project, created for IOTA, is a Sorting Visualizer that demonstrates how various sorting algorithms work by visualizing them in real-time using the Tkinter library in Python.

#Overview
Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science, and understanding their behavior can significantly enhance your knowledge of how data structures and algorithms function. This project provides an interactive way to observe and learn about different sorting techniques through visual representation.

#Features
Visualizes Multiple Sorting Algorithms: The project includes visualizations for several common sorting algorithms, such as:

Bubble Sort
Quick Sort
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
#Real-Time Visualization: The sorting process is displayed in real-time, allowing you to observe each step of the algorithm as it happens.

#Customizable Speed: You can adjust the speed of the visualization to slow down or speed up the sorting process, helping you understand the algorithm's behavior in greater detail.

#Technologies Used
Python: The core language used for implementing the sorting algorithms.
Tkinter: A Python library used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing the sorting processes.
#How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
Install the Tkinter library if it's not already included with your Python installation.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Run the main.py file to launch the sorting visualizer.
Select the sorting algorithm you'd like to visualize and adjust the speed as desired.
#Purpose
This project is designed to help users, especially students and beginners, understand how different sorting algorithms work through interactive and engaging visualizations.

#Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add more sorting algorithms, improve the visualization, or enhance the user interface, feel free to submit a pull request.
